5,er4kiq,Spanish is a white language,1,0,usa,"With recent controversies regarding some people calling Antonio Banderas a ""person of color"" seemingly just because he is Spanish speaking, nobody has mentioned the fact that Spanish is a white language that is used by people of color. 

Often you Mexicans living in the US talking about how important it is to know Spanish since it's ""their"" language. No Filipino living in China would say how important it is to know English since it's ""their language"". 

In both cases, the British and Spanish empire forced everyone from both countries to learn the colonial masters respective language. The most absurd thing is when a few people have said that it's racist for white people to learn Spanish, since it's ""cultural appropriation"". 

I do get that today, the language is associated with people of color in that particular part of the world, but the language still is a European language invented by white people. Brazil got Portuguese instead, but any middle or south american country could just as well have gotten French, Italian or Dutch if those countries had had the upper hand in colonization at that time. Nobody would call Dutch anything but a white European language even if it was the main language in Mexico.",https://www.reddit.com/r/usa/comments/er4kiq/spanish_is_a_white_language/,14,1579506580.0

3. Low income tax. (Don't care about sales tax) 
4. Cheap housing.
5. I prefer the city over nature, idealy I'd live in a suburb.

Is this true? Any things in terms of law we should watch out for? Are there any cool acitivities which we can do with the age of 19? Is Silicon Valley worth a visit?
