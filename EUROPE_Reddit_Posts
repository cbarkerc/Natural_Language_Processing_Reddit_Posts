If you are interested in joining join the Discord via this link https://discordapp.com/invite/europe or the sidebar, go to #bot_commands and type *.assign eu4*, most countries are already picked obviously but we are always looking for people to substitute players who can't make it for a session and some countries might be abandoned by their player and could need a replacement.
