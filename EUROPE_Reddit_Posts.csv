1,es4wvu,Studying Computer Science in the EU/EEA as an Australian citizen,0,0,europe,"Dear fellow Redditors,

Recently I have been browsing through European universities, looking for the cheapest and easiest (in terms of admission) Bachelor of Computer Science (preferably heavily leaning towards software engineering) degrees to get.

I'm a bit worried about my chances of ever being accepted because;
 
1. I'm an Australian citizen only,
2. I only speak English, and
3. I'm 4 years out of high school and never received an ATAR (NSW high school ranking system - similar to British A-levels).

I have, however, received a Certificate IV in Programming at TAFE NSW (college, not university) and have 5+ months' experience of working professionally in the software engineering sector within Sydney.

Having said this, would anyone happen to know of any cheap (or even ~free, like with Deutschland!) universities which would potentially allow me to study there? Do I need to study at university in Australia first (I've been accepted into local universities)?

There have been some instances where universities offered Computer Science at around 2.000/4.000EUR per year, such as Saxion University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Is this potentially the cheapest I could get as an international student?

Many, many thanks,

If do you want to see a sky with all of its stars, now you have to go thousands of km's for this purpose.

It’s been estimated that 99 percent of people in the United States and Europe can no longer see that milky swath of the Milky Way.

We’ve got whole generations of people in the North America & Europe who have never seen the Milky Way. It’s a big part of our connection to the cosmos — and it’s been lost.

The only areas that are still truly dark there, are some little portions (in black) within Iceland; Scandinavia, and some very remote Russia.
